# GA-Cascade-Control-HVAC
This repo uses a genetic algorithm to optimize the PID gains of two controllers in a cascade control system. This investigation was conducted for a course on Modern Control Engineering and it seeks to replicate the results found in a paper titled "Application of the genetic algorithm for cascade control of a HVAC system" by D. Ivanova, N. Valov, and M. Deyanov .
